    Arjuna, one of the five Pandava brothers, who are the heroes of the Indian epic the Mahabharata. Arjuna, son of the god Indra, is famous for his archery (he can shoot with either hand) and for the magical weapons that he wins from the god Shiva.
    The Bhagavad Gita is one of several texts within the Hindu religion (the other major sources being the Vedas and Upanishads). However, the Bhagavad Gita relays metaphysical concepts through the relationship between Krishna and Arjuna. 
    Krishna explains to him that it is his duty to fight because of a Hindu concept called Dharma. Dharma is the idea that everyone has a purpose and is responsible for living out that purpose. Every individual has a predestined duty and in this case, Arjuna's duty is to fight as a warrior.
