    SURYAPUTRA KARNA

<p class="mar">
    Karna on his way to becoming a great warrior.

He was the son of Surya and Kunti. He was born to Kunti before her marriage with Pandu. Kunti thus abandoned him. He was then saved by Adhirath, who was a charioteer. Karna since his childhood only decided to become an archer. He learnt archery from Lord Parshurama and lied him about his identity of being a Brahmin. But his lie was soon discovered and Parshurama cursed him.

After that Duryodhana made him the king of Anga and befriended him. Later, he along with Shakuni, devised a plan to insult Draupadi, wife of the Pandavas. They arranged a gambling where Yudhishthir lost all of his properties including Draupadi. Duryodhana asked Dushasan to disrobe her but failed as Lord Krishna saved her dignity. The Pandavas and Draupadi were sent for an exile of 13 years. This sowed the seeds of Mahabharata war.

Indra, in disguise of a Brahmin took Karna's armour and earrings. Later, he came to know about his true identity of Kunti and Surya's son but he decided to fight for Duryodhana blaming Yudhishthir for owing Draupadi. The Mahabharata war resulted in the death of Karna, Bheeshma, Drona, and many of the Kauravas. Thus, the Pandavas won the war. Yudhishthir was made the king of Hastinapura.

Gandhari cursed Krishna for destroying Kuru Vansh. Her curse showed result after 36 years and Krishna's dynasty also got destroyed. A hunter named Jara killed Krishna mistakenly. Thus, the Pandavas decided to go to heaven where they met the Kauravas and Karna. The show ended with Krishna's blessings to everyone.
